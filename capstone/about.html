                    This website was founded by Prof. Steve Trewick of Massey
                    University in 2019. It is one of many that provides 
                    scientific information into the global issue of the 
                    Anthropocene, i.e. the over-use of our planet’s limited 
                    resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team began the development of the
                    <i>New Zealand Centre for Planetary Ecology</i> which seeks 
                    to contribute to an effective, consistent, and orderly
                    sustainability transition for Aotearoa/New Zealand’s people,
                    economy, and environment. Importantly this national level 
                    initiative is couched in terms of the global perspective and
                    draws on a concept called the nine planetary boundaries. 
                    Some of our activity in this space can be viewed at:

                <p>
                    The problem is very big, too big to manage and indeed too
                    big for us to fully comprehend. So, we set up the Turitea
                    Project to look at ways to visualise, communicate, share,
                    and inform on a small section of local geography. In part, 
                    this is aimed at the local community, in part a wider 
                    audience, and in part identifying what is needed and how 
                    difficult it is to communicate the issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Turitea stream begins its journey in Tararua Ranges of
                    the Manawatu region of New Zealand, and finally flows into 
                    the Manawatu river. It is a living and dynamic system 
                    although this is rarely recognised by most people. The 
                    stream and its catchment has all the components that could 
                    be seen on any part of the planet or indeed the planet as a 
                    whole. The te reo Māori translation means clear bright 
                    water. So we can view the Turitea as a biological system, a
                    geographic/hydrological system, a water resource, or as
                    simple a metaphor.

                    Within the Turitea catchment, water accumulates from rain, 
                    flowing over and through plants, animals, microbes, fungi 
                    and soil before it reaches the path of the stream, which 
                    itself moves over time by eroding and depositing sediment. 
                    At any one moment the water in the stream is not the same 
                    water as at other times; the life in it (from bacteria to 
                    multicellular creatures), the sediment, and the dissolved 
                    chemicals are constantly changing even if the average 
                    characteristics of the stream are often described as if they
                    are fixed. For example, we know that the amount of dissolved 
                    oxygen is a good indicator of how much life there is in the 
                    water, but very different measures of oxygen are gained at 
                    night, day, morning, evening, after heavy rain, and after 
                    drought.

                    It is the often rare and extreme levels that dictates much 
                    of the biological composition and biodiversity. The way the 
                    physical and biological aspects of the catchment interact 
                    can appear static but we know that small and large scale 
                    change is constantly going on. Some is a variation around a 
                    mean, but the extent and skew of that variation is 
                    important. Some is unusual variation. For example, the shape 
                    of the catchment with a series of nearly level terraces at 
                    different elevations is the product of the ancestral stream 
                    winding across the landscape and carving its way over many 
                    thousands of years. The fact that most of the catchment is 
                    now clothed in grassland is the result of fires set by 
                    people in the last 200 years to remove the forest that once 
                    flourished here. How it looks and functions now is not how 
                    it did in the past or will be in the future.

                    In order for people to understand their role in the 
                    environment they need to see how their activity or lack of 
                    it impacts that environment. Simply then, the task for this  
                    project is find ways to bring this discussion to life.
